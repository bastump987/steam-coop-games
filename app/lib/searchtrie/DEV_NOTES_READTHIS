The data structure of the SearchTrie is flawed.
The "root" should be a dictionary, functioning
exactly the same as the "children" dictionary
in the SearchNode objects.  It is currently
implemented as an instance of SearchNode, which
is why the .search method fails.  After this
change, the "addTerm" method will have to be
changed as well, and I predict it will actually
simplify the algorithm quite a bit.
